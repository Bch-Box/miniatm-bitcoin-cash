## Summary

MiniATM is a compact and simple Bitcoin Cash ATM.
Easy to use and to reproduce, open source and low-cost.
Simple one-way Fiat-to-Crypto exchange to spread BCH adoption. 

Designed for DIY fabrication with off-the-shelf components. 
Anyone is free to build and distribute units locally, where ever they may be. 
Comprised only of a tablet computer, bill validator and a laser-cut
acrylic structure. Make or purchase as a KIT with a price target under 600$.

Units are securely fixed on walls by tamper proof metal brackets. 
Anti-theft cables are used for over-the-counter locations.
